/**
 * The page's closing tier. Three bands, in decreasing weight: who this is,
 * where it came from, and what to do when it disagrees with the code.
 *
 * It used to be a single run-on sentence with "Back to top" floated opposite
 * it on `items-baseline`. That had three faults worth naming, because they are
 * easy to reintroduce:
 *
 *   1. `items-baseline` aligns to the *first* line of a wrapping paragraph, so
 *      the button drifted level with line one of three and read as unplaced.
 *   2. The provenance chips could break mid-token -- `v-4.0.0` wrapped as
 *      "v-" / "4.0.0" across two lines, which reads as a broken build rather
 *      than a branch name. Hence `whitespace-nowrap` on every chip here.
 *   3. Provenance and instruction were the same sentence. A tester filing a
 *      defect wants the first as fields they can copy; the second is advice
 *      and belongs on its own line.

 * answers "how is this journey going", this answers "where in the run are the
 * failures" -- the question a flat percentage bar cannot answer at all.
 *
 * A failure is drawn taller as well as red, so it reads as a shape. That
 * survives greyscale, a colourblind reader, and a printer dropping
 * backgrounds, which is the same ordering GutterSegment above is built on.
 *
 * The group is the link; ticks are not individually clickable. At four pixels
 * wide they would be a target nobody can hit, and clicking anywhere in a
 * journey's span jumps to the section that holds all of them. That also makes
 * the whole strip a mouse shortcut for something the rail already offers with
 * a real name, which is why it is aria-hidden and out of the tab order -- a
 * screen reader gets the figures below it as plain text instead of a second
 * set of twenty-one identical links.

 * The three-state control, repeated on every one of 200-odd rows. Both states

 * -- rather than a solid fill, so 200 rows of controls never shout over the
 * case titles. The gutter is what carries the run at full strength.
 *
 * The active state is drawn by an outline, not by a deeper wash. That is a
 * contrast requirement rather than a preference: the label is the same hue as
 * the wash behind it, so every step of extra fill eats the contrast between
 * them. In dark the old 20%/30% washes put the label at 2.5-3.6:1, well under
 * AA. Fill is now fixed per theme at a level the label clears comfortably, and
 * hover moves the border instead.
 *
 * Clicking the active verdict clears it, which is what a tester expects from a
 * toggle and saves a third button.

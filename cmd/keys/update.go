// parameters:
//
// - keysCmd: The parent command under which the update command will be added.

// returns:
//
// - *cobra.Command: The initialized update command.

// This function is called in the main function of the application to set up the command structure.

// The update command is a subcommand of the keys command and is used to update information about a specific key.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// updateCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// updateCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")

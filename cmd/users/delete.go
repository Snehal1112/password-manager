// - usersCmd: The parent command under which the delete command will be added.

// This function is called in the main function of the application to set up the command structure.
// It is part of the Cobra library, which is used for creating command-line applications in Go.

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// deleteCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")

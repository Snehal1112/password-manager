// command-line applications in Go. The login command is used to authenticate
// a user and may require additional flags or configuration settings in the future.
// The command is defined using the Cobra library, which provides a simple way
// to create command-line applications in Go. The login command is a subcommand
// of the users command and is used to authenticate a user. It may require
// additional flags or configuration settings in the future.

	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// loginCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// loginCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
